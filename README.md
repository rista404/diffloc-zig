# Diffloc in Zig

A rewrite of [diffloc](https://github.com/rista404/diffloc) in Zig. I wanted to play around with Zig so I rewrote this small utility originally written in Go. My first ever Zig program so don't go harsh on me.

Use it like so:
```sh
diffloc # difference in the working tree

# TBD

diffloc HEAD~1 # difference from the last commit

diffloc development # difference from the 'development' branch
```
